* akari

A directory server written entirely in lisp.

This server was written to serve as a challenge (pun intended) in PrismCTF.

Was accessible on:

:host nyx.istaroth.xyz
:port 54321

** vulnerability

- directory traversal:
  
  user can access files outside of intended directory, using ~../~ as
  the url

** note

this vulnerability is (probably) not possible to be exploited from the
browser, as browsers remove ~../~ part
